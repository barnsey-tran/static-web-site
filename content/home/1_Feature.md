<!-- 
    Specifying the feature image of a post/blog in the content of markdown proves to be difficult to isolate and apply style or layout on the feature image and the content
    In this example, the feature image is specified as property of markdown file instead of in the markdown content.
    The only downside of this approach is the editor (or Tom) can't see the feature image in the markdown preview panel. Might need to provide a post/blog preview panel similar to the word press.

# Feature 1
Logo is blue with transparent background. I think it is ok but not great.

## Place image to the left
Match our theme specification

## Usage
Not very applicable for the web applications.
